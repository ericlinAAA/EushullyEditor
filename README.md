# EushullyEditor
EuhullyEditor Library, a tool to make your own Eushully script editor easy

#BETA VERSION
This is my first version, i test with kamidori, and work, if don't work with your game, try contact-me or you configure the tool to your script format.
This version can't have all resources working, i'm analyzing the Eusshully format, i need know more about scripts to write a tool with support to add new breakline or remove.

Strings it's separed with the char '|' you can't remove this, the script have more than 1 strings in a single dialog, and to the program know how rewrite that string, need separe with '|'

Good Lucky
